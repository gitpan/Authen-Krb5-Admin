Authen::Krb5::Admin is an object-oriented interface to the Kerberos 5
admin server.  Currently only MIT KDCs are supported, but the author
envisions seamless integration with other KDCs.


PREREQUISITES

Authen::Krb5::Admin requires Perl 5.005 or greater and Jeff Horwitz's
Authen::Krb5 module from CPAN.


INSTALLATION

To install Authen::Krb5::Admin without testing, run the standard
sequence:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

The first step will prompt you for a principal with administrative
privileges on the KDC for running the test suite.  Re-run this step to
change which principal to use.


TESTING

To run the test suite as part of the install, use

	perl Makefile.PL
	make test
	make install

This step requires administrative access to the KDC by the principal
specified in the first step.  It will create a principal, by default
"perl_test", which should NOT already exist on the KDC.  If you
already have a principal called perl_test, change Makefile.PL to use a
different test principal, and start over.
